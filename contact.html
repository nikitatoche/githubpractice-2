 <center><p> Along with tea stalls, people prefer to set up a pan shop .
     It is a cost-effective business plan as one can start at a low level.
     Chewing a pan after having food is a habit of most Indians.
      Pan is made using betel leaves which is a symbol of
       good fortune.</p></center>
